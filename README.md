These are python projects that are of two types. One is related to development in which I created an Email greetings App that sends greeting emails automatically to different recepients that the user specifies according to a certain template without the need to retype the email each time. While the other app is a weather App that helps the user sends to the emails of the clients that he specifies weather details at their location and at the current time. The other type are python scripts that can enhance ethical hacking in a way that by using them you can find important security issues and vulnerabilities in your software, and thus fix them. Use Them Wisely.
